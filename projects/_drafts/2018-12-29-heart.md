description: Started off trying to draw a Heart in JavaScript, ended up grazing the complex realm for the first time...

<!-- todo add link -->
For my bubble trouble game, I decided I wanted to have heart shapes to indicate lives at the top of the screen. I'm writing the game from scratch though, using nothing other than the JavaScript canvas scripting API - and of course it's not like there's just a built-in function that you can call and it'll draw you a heart. Who knew I'd spend almost an entire day working on this one aspect though...

There's a couple of ways you could go about drawing heart-shapes:
1. Just use a sprite image
2. Bezier curves !
3. Graphing equations

## Sprites

First of all, I'm dismissing option `1.` straight away: right now, my game is just two neat little files: `bubbletrouble.js` which is the script, and `index.html` which literally just defines a canvas and loads the script - and I want to keep it that way. I don't really want to introduce an extra `assets` folder to the mix with sprite images or something like that - besides, that isn't really my style (if you've seen some of my other games, you know what I mean).

## Bezier

As for Bezier curves, I'm a real fan of them so they could be a way to go. The following is an example of a heart drawn with some quadratic bezier curves. One look at those strange rounded tops of the heart, though, and I feel like I can do better. Moving swiftly on to graphing equations...

<div class="contentbox" style="
    max-width: 500px;
    margin: 0 auto;
">
    <canvas id='cbezier'></canvas>
    <script>
        (function(){
            var c = document.getElementById('cbezier'),
            cx = c.getContext('2d');

            function draw(){
                cx.clearRect(0,0,cx.canvas.width,cx.canvas.height);

                var w = c.width*0.7, h = c.height*0.7;
                var d = Math.min(w, h);
                var k = 10;
                cx.moveTo(k, k + d / 4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k, k, k + d / 4, k);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d / 2, k, k + d / 2, k + d / 4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d / 2, k, k + d * 3/4, k);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d, k, k + d, k + d / 4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d, k + d / 2, k + d * 3/4, k + d * 3/4);
                cx.lineTo(k + d / 2, k + d);
                cx.lineTo(k + d / 4, k + d * 3/4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k, k + d / 2, k, k + d / 4);
                cx.stroke();
            }

            function resizeCanvas() {
                c.width = c.parentElement.clientWidth-40;
                c.height = c.width*(3/4); // ratio
                draw();
            }
            window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas, false);
            resizeCanvas();
        })();
    </script>
</div>

## Graphing Equations

This is basically the focus of this article, and it's what I experimented around with the most. I found a couple of heart equations [on Wolfram MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html) and here are two I liked...

### Equation 1

$$
\left(x^2+y^2-1\right)^3-x^2y^3=0
$$

![equation 1](https://i.imgur.com/0gjvKGJ.png){: style="max-width:500px"}

This equation is quite neat. The intersection points with the axes are at nice values and it probably looks the best out of all the hearts here.

I first rearranged the equation into a $$y=f(x)$$ form so that I can graph it easier with code:

![rearranging](https://i.imgur.com/vtqz0Zd.jpg){: style="max-width:500px"}

<center>It was just a case of collecting like terms and completing the square.</center>

This is the rearranged version:

{% comment %}
$$
y=\frac{
    x^{\frac{2}{3}}
    \pm
    \sqrt{
        x^{\frac{4}{3}}
        -4(x^2-1)
    }
}{2}
$$

Here's how I implemented the drawing of this equation:

```js
/**
 * @param s size
 */
function drawHeart(x,y,s){
    /**
     * @param n negative sqrt version or not
     */
    function f(x,n=false){
        var ret = Math.pow(x,2,3);
        var part = Math.pow(Math.pow(x,4,3)-4*(x*x-1),1,2);
        
        if(n){
            part*=-1;
        }
        
        return (ret+part)/2;
    }

    function path(n=false){
        for(var i=-1.2*s+x;i<1.2*s+x;i+=s/2000){
            var id = ((1/s)*i)-(x/s); // i dash: i with transformations applied
            var j = -s*f(id,n)+y;
            if(n){
                j-=s/40; // discontinuity correction
            }
            cx.fillRect(i,j,1,1); // draw pixel at (i,j)
        }
    }

    // top
    path(false); // false = positive sqrt

    // bottom
    path(true); // true = negative sqrt
}
```

Note:<br>
The equation has a $$\pm$$ so I had to split the drawing into two parts: one where I take the positive sqrt (red) and one where I take the negative sqrt (blue) for that bit in the equation. Guess it takes two halves to draw a heart :)  <sup>(they're not halves area-wise though)</sup>

![](https://i.imgur.com/5B0THmP.png){: style="max-width:500px"}
<center>Here are the two halves</center>

Other notes:
1. The 'discontinuity correction' refers to an adjustment I made to move the bottom part up slightly so that it looks like the two parts are more connected.
2. The y coordinate is flipped because the coordinate system is such that the origin is the top-left in JavaScript (usually the case with programs)
3. I do some transformations (see the variable 'id') so that the drawing takes into account the specified x and y locations as well as the 's' (size multiplier) variable
4. The domain of the equation is taken roughly to be $$-1.2<x<1.2$$
5. The 's' variable is divided by 2000 to approximately convert the unit of 's' to pixels.

Here is the result:

<div class="contentbox" style="
    max-width: 500px;
    margin: 0 auto;
">
    <canvas id='ceq11'></canvas>
    <script>
        (function(){
        var c = document.getElementById('ceq11'),
        cx = c.getContext('2d');

        function resizeCanvas() {
            c.width = c.parentElement.clientWidth-40;
            c.height = c.width*(3/4); // ratio
            draw();
        }
        window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas, false);
        resizeCanvas();

        /**
        * @param s size
        */
        function drawHeart(x,y,s){
            /**
            * @param n negative sqrt version or not
            */
            function f(x,n=false){
                var ret = Math.pow(x,2/3);
                var part = Math.pow(Math.pow(x,4/3)-4*(x*x-1),1/2);
                
                if(n){
                    part*=-1;
                }
                
                return (ret+part)/2;
            }

            function path(n=false){
                for(var i=-1.2*s+x;i<1.2*s+x;i+=s/2000){
                    var id = ((1/s)*i)-(x/s); // i dash: i with transformations applied
                    var j = -s*f(id,n)+y;
                    if(n){
                        j-=s/40; // discontinuity correction
                    }
                    cx.fillRect(i,j,1,1);
                }
            }

            // top
            cx.fillStyle = '#F25F5C';
            path(false); // false = positive sqrt

            // bottom
            cx.fillStyle = '#247BA0';
            path(true); // true = negative sqrt
        }

        function draw(){
            drawHeart(cx.canvas.width/2,cx.canvas.height/2,cx.canvas.width/5);
        }
        })();
    </script>
</div>

Wait ... what? I was so confused. Did I do something wrong rearranging? Some other error?

After a bunch of debugging, I found out that something strange was happening with the built-in `Math.pow` function itself. The following image is an observation I made which sums it up:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/585bc749fc93f680fe3290c4cb3ebc94.png){: style="max-width: 500px"}

I'd been taught in school, etc, that these two were the same thing. I remember learning the equation

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;x^{\frac{m}{n}}&space;=&space;\sqrt[n]{x^m}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;x^{\frac{m}{n}}&space;=&space;\sqrt[n]{x^m}" title="x^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{x^m}" /></a>

What's more, my (physical) calculator gives the answer I expected for that same exact question (as does the graphing software, desmos, I used to make those graph images above).

Calculating the same thing in Python gives an even more interesting result.

<center>Python result</center>

This result basically confirmed my suspicion that while I was here minding my business, trying to draw some hearts, I had inadvertently grazed the complex realm - which is actually pretty awesome.

Looking around, it turns out it's actually in the ECMAScript specification that `Math.pow` should return NaN in situations like this (negative base, non-integer exponent).

Also, looking around [on WolframAlpha](http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2013/04/26/get-real-with-wolframalpha-computing-roots/), I found out that this is essentially because the equation I had learnt in school (mentioned earlier) essentially had the caveat that we were taking the _real valued_ root.

Now, this is my first time ever coming across complex numbers, but I'm going to try explain what is going on with my understanding from what I've been reading. In this situation, there are actually three solutions, it's just that one of them is _real_ and the other two are _complex_. The three solutions are (approx):

1. $$2.924...$$.  <small>(nb: this one is real)</small>
2. $$-1.462... + 2.532...j$$.
3. $$-1.462... - 2.532...j$$.
