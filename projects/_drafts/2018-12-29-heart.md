For my bubble trouble game, I decided I wanted to have heart shapes to indicate lives at the top of the screen. I'm writing the game from scratch though, using nothing other than the JavaScript canvas scripting API - and of course it's not like there's just a built-in function that you can call and it'll draw you a heart. Who knew I'd spend almost an entire day working on this one aspect though...

There's a couple of ways you could go about drawing heart-shapes:
1. Just use a sprite image
2. Bezier curves !
3. Graphing equations

## Sprites

First of all, I'm dismissing option `1.` straight away: right now, my game is just two neat little files: `bubbletrouble.js` which is the script, and `index.html` which literally just defines a canvas and loads the script - and I want to keep it that way. I don't really want to introduce an extra `assets` folder to the mix with sprite images or something like that - besides, that isn't really my style (if you've seen some of my other games, you know what I mean).

## Bezier

As for Bezier curves, I'm a real fan of them so they could be a way to go. The following is an example of a heart drawn with some quadratic bezier curves. One look at those strange rounded tops of the heart, though, and I feel like I can do better. Moving swiftly on to graphing equations...

<div class="contentbox" style="
    max-width: 500px;
    margin: 0 auto;
">
    <canvas id='cbezier'></canvas>
    <script>
        (function(){
            var c = document.getElementById('cbezier'),
            cx = c.getContext('2d');

            function draw(){
                cx.clearRect(0,0,cx.canvas.width,cx.canvas.height);

                var w = c.width*0.7, h = c.height*0.7;
                var d = Math.min(w, h);
                var k = 10;
                cx.moveTo(k, k + d / 4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k, k, k + d / 4, k);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d / 2, k, k + d / 2, k + d / 4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d / 2, k, k + d * 3/4, k);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d, k, k + d, k + d / 4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k + d, k + d / 2, k + d * 3/4, k + d * 3/4);
                cx.lineTo(k + d / 2, k + d);
                cx.lineTo(k + d / 4, k + d * 3/4);
                cx.quadraticCurveTo(k, k + d / 2, k, k + d / 4);
                cx.stroke();
            }

            function resizeCanvas() {
                c.width = c.parentElement.clientWidth-40;
                c.height = c.width*(3/4); // ratio
                draw();
            }
            window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas, false);
            resizeCanvas();
        })();
    </script>
</div>

## Graphing Equations

This is basically the focus of this article, and it's what I experimented around with the most. I found a couple of heart equations [on Wolfram MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html) and here are two I liked...

### Equation 1

$$
\left(x^2+y^2-1\right)^3-x^2y^3=0
$$

![equation 1](https://i.imgur.com/0gjvKGJ.png)

This equation is quite neat. The intersection points with the axes are at nice values and it probably looks the best out of all the hearts here.

I first rearranged the equation into a $$y=f(x)$$ form so that I can graph it easier with code:

![rearranging](https://i.imgur.com/vtqz0Zd.jpg)

<center>It was just a case of collecting like terms and completing the square.</center>

This is the rearranged version:

{% comment %}
$$
y=\frac{
    x^{\frac{2}{3}}
    \pm
    \sqrt{
        x^{\frac{4}{3}}
        -4(x^2-1)
    }
}{2}
$$

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{130}&space;y=\frac{&space;x^{\frac{2}{3}}&space;\pm&space;\sqrt{&space;x^{\frac{4}{3}}&space;-4(x^2-1)&space;}&space;}{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\dpi{130}&space;y=\frac{&space;x^{\frac{2}{3}}&space;\pm&space;\sqrt{&space;x^{\frac{4}{3}}&space;-4(x^2-1)&space;}&space;}{2}" title="y=\frac{ x^{\frac{2}{3}} \pm \sqrt{ x^{\frac{4}{3}} -4(x^2-1) } }{2}"/></a>

Here's how I implemented the drawing of this equation:

```js
/**
 * @param s size
 */
function drawHeart(x,y,s){
    /**
     * @param n negative sqrt version or not
     */
    function f(x,n=false){
        var ret = Math.pow(x,2,3);
        var part = Math.pow(Math.pow(x,4,3)-4*(x*x-1),1,2);
        
        if(n){
            part*=-1;
        }
        
        return (ret+part)/2;
    }

    function path(n=false){
        for(var i=-1.2*s+x;i<1.2*s+x;i+=s/2000){
            var id = ((1/s)*i)-(x/s); // i dash: i with transformations applied
            var j = -s*f(id,n)+y;
            if(n){
                j-=s/40; // discontinuity correction
            }
            cx.fillRect(i,j,1,1); // draw pixel at (i,j)
        }
    }

    // top
    path(false); // false = positive sqrt

    // bottom
    path(true); // true = negative sqrt
}
```

Note:<br>
The equation has a $$\pm$$ so I had to split the drawing into two parts: one where I take the positive sqrt (red) and one where I take the negative sqrt (blue) for that bit in the equation. Guess it takes two halves to draw a heart :)  <sup>(they're not halves area-wise though)</sup>

![](https://i.imgur.com/5B0THmP.png)
<center>Here are the two halves</center>

Other notes:
1. The 'discontinuity correction' refers to an adjustment I made to move the bottom part up slightly so that it looks like the two parts are more connected.
2. The y coordinate is flipped because the coordinate system is such that the origin is the top-left in JavaScript (usually the case with programs)
3. I do some transformations (see the variable 'id') so that the drawing takes into account the specified x and y locations as well as the 's' (size multiplier) variable
4. The domain of the equation is taken roughly to be $$-1.2<x<1.2$$
5. The 's' variable is divided by 2000 to approximately convert the unit of 's' to pixels.

Here is the result:

<div class="contentbox" style="

        function resizeCanvas() {
            c.width = c.parentElement.clientWidth-40;
            c.height = c.width*(3/4); // ratio
            draw();
        }
        window.addEventListener('resize', resizeCanvas, false);
        resizeCanvas();

        /**
        * @param s size
        */
        function drawHeart(x,y,s){
            /**
            * @param n negative sqrt version or not
            */
            function f(x,n=false){
                var ret = Math.pow(x,2/3);
                var part = Math.pow(Math.pow(x,4/3)-4*(x*x-1),1/2);
                
                if(n){
                    part*=-1;
                }
                
                return (ret+part)/2;
            }

            function path(n=false){
                for(var i=-1.2*s+x;i<1.2*s+x;i+=s/2000){
                    var id = ((1/s)*i)-(x/s); // i dash: i with transformations applied
                    var j = -s*f(id,n)+y;
                    if(n){
                        j-=s/40; // discontinuity correction
                    }
                    cx.fillRect(i,j,1,1);
                }
            }

            cx.fillStyle = '#247BA0';
            path(true); // true = negative sqrt
        }

        function draw(){
            drawHeart(cx.canvas.width/2,cx.canvas.height/2,cx.canvas.width/5);
        }
        })();
    </script>

Wait ... what? I was so confused. Did I do something wrong rearranging? Some other error?

After a bunch of debugging, I found out that something strange was happening with the built-in `Math.pow` function itself. The following image is an observation I made which sums it up:

![](https://i.gyazo.com/585bc749fc93f680fe3290c4cb3ebc94.png)

I'd been taught in school, etc, that these two were the same thing. I remember learning the equation

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;x^{\frac{m}{n}}&space;=&space;\sqrt[n]{x^m}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;x^{\frac{m}{n}}&space;=&space;\sqrt[n]{x^m}" title="x^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{x^m}" /></a>

What's more, my (physical) calculator gives the answer I expected for that same exact question (as does the graphing software, desmos, I used to make those graph images above).

![](https://i.imgur.com/oMWvDFj.jpg)
<center>Physical calculator result</center>

Calculating the same thing in Python gives an even more interesting result.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/d95a061bc5a4c14f45f652505ade8c25.png)
<center>Python result</center>

This result basically confirmed my suspicion that while I was here minding my business, trying to draw some hearts, I had inadvertently grazed the complex realm - which is actually pretty awesome.

Looking around, it turns out it's actually in the ECMAScript specification that `Math.pow` should return NaN in situations like this (negative base, non-integer exponent).

Also, looking around [on WolframAlpha](http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2013/04/26/get-real-with-wolframalpha-computing-roots/), I found out that the equation I had learnt in school (mentioned earlier) essentially had the caveat that we were taking the _real valued_ root.

Note that in this situation, we are essentially cubing a negative number: <img src="https://i.imgur.com/p7ta9ox.png" style="
    padding: 0;
    display: inline;
    margin: 0;
">.

Now, this is my first time ever coming across complex numbers, but I'm going to try explain what is going on with my understanding from what I've been reading. In this situation, there are actually _three_ solutions, it's just that one of them is _real_ and the other two are _complex_.

We can plot these on a graph with the horizontal axis being real numbers and the vertical axis being imaginary (-1j,0,1j,2j,..). Here they are for this situation:

![](https://i.imgur.com/S0xRedi.png)
<center>roots of (-5)^(2/3) in the complex plane</center>

Notice how the blue solution lies exactly on the horizontal axis - this means that it doesn't have an imaginary part and so is a real number. This real solution (2.924...) is what my calculator gets.

The problem with $$\frac{2}{3}$$ is that JavaScript doesn't store fractions like that at all: it first has to convert it into its decimal representation. The decimal representation in this case is non-terminating though: it's $$0.66666...$$. Of course we can't store an infinite amount of decimal places so this number is truncated at some point.

![](https://i.gyazo.com/9d18a11812a5c054e1968126d019fa94.png)
<center>JavaScript truncates the value</center>

Technically this means that there will always be a very very slight inaccuracy when working with any kind of fraction like this in most programming languages, but that inaccuracy is so tiny that we don't have to worry about it too much at all - especially when we're only dealing with real numbers.

So in other words, when we try to calculate $$(-5)^{\frac{2}{3}}$$ in JavaScript, what it's actually trying to do is $$(-5)^{0.6666666666666666}$$ which is of course going to be super super close to what we want, but not exactly.

The problem is that this slight difference means that our roots as shown in that diagram above get rotated a very very slight amount about the origin <sup>(also the radius of the circle - the magnitude of the numbers - reduces ever so slightly too)</sup>. Here's an exaggerated plot showing the effects:

![](https://i.imgur.com/ysVuVQ3.png)
<center>The points are slightly rotated about the origin</center>

As we can see in the diagram, the blue solution doesn't lie exactly on the real axis anymore - it's super close but not _exactly_. As you can see, there are actually no exact real solutions.

Well dealing with complex numbers seems to be outside the scope of a simple browser language like JavaScript - and trying to guess real roots close to the solutions seems to be beyond it as well. These considerations must have been why it was decided that JavaScript should just return `NaN` for difficult cases like this.

Python (version 3) actually can handle complex numbers, however, and it turns out that the solution it gave earlier was the red solution - a solution known as the _principal root_, and there's probably some good reasoning behind why it gave that one and not the blue one, for example (which I'll probably find out more about when I look at complex numbers in greater detail in future).


----

With this explanation, I am satisfied with my understanding of what's going on. The problem remains though: how do I actually fix the heart drawing.

Well, the problem essentially arises from the fact that $$\frac{2}{3}$$ can't exactly be represented as decimal. To get around this, I decided to not evaluate the fraction straight away, and instead incorporate the numerator and denominator directly into our calculations. I.e: create a function which takes the three inputs $$(x,m,n)$$ corresponding to a value of the form $$x^{\frac{m}{n}}$$ and returns the real root.

Well of course, using the equation from earlier, <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tvKeUHS.png" style="
    padding: 0;
    display: inline;
    margin: 0;
">, we can implement this by simply taking the n-th root of $$x^m$$ as long as that root function finds the _real root_. Luckily, JavaScript has `Math.sqrt` and `Math.cbrt` which can find the real root of something when it is square rooted or cube rooted (when `n` is 2 or 3) - that's why `Math.cbrt` worked earlier. JavaScript hasn't got a n-th root function though, because again, that seems to be beyond the scope of a simple language - and cube rooting and square rooting is the most people usually need to worry about.

This basically means that if I rewrite my heart equation as the following, I should be able to implement it in JavaScript making use of the `Math.cbrt` function:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;y=\frac{&space;\sqrt[3]{x^2}&space;\pm&space;\sqrt{&space;\sqrt[3]{x^4}&space;-4(x^2-1)&space;}&space;}{2}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;y=\frac{&space;\sqrt[3]{x^2}&space;\pm&space;\sqrt{&space;\sqrt[3]{x^4}&space;-4(x^2-1)&space;}&space;}{2}" title="y=\frac{ \sqrt[3]{x^2} \pm \sqrt{ \sqrt[3]{x^4} -4(x^2-1) } }{2}" /></a>

To me, this didn't seem satisfactory though. Sure, in this case, it works out because I end up not having to use anything more than the cube root, but it could have easily been otherwise. What if I wanted to compute <img src="https://i.imgur.com/2tDAeKQ.png" style="
    padding: 0;
    display: inline;
    margin: 0;
">?

Basically, leaving that function I was talking about as something like the following didn't feel satisfactory to me at all:

```js
/**
 * @param x base
 * @param m exponent numerator
 * @param n exponent denominator
 */
function pow(x,m,n){
    if(n==1){
        return Math.pow(x,m);
    }
    else if(n==2){
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x,m));
    }
    else if(n==3){
        return Math.cbrt(Math.pow(x,m));
    }
    else{
        // what do...?
    }
}
```

Well, I thought about how to emulate my calculator a little and this is what I observed:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\dpi{150}&space;x^{\frac{m}{n}}&space;=&space;(\text{sign}(x)({\left&space;|&space;x&space;\right&space;|}^{\frac{1}{n}}))^m" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\dpi{150}&space;x^{\frac{m}{n}}&space;=&space;(\text{sign}(x)({\left&space;|&space;x&space;\right&space;|}^{\frac{1}{n}}))^m" title="x^{\frac{m}{n}} = (\text{sign}(x)({\left | x \right |}^{\frac{1}{n}}))^m" /></a>

As long as when $$x<0$$, $$n$$ is even (otherwise my calculator gives a math error). Where sign(x) is a function which returns $$-1$$ if $$x<0$$ and $$1$$ if $$x>0$$ (and $$0$$ if $$x=0$$).

And here's how I implemented this in code:

```js
function pow(x,m,n){
    if(x<0 && n%2==0){
        return NaN;
    }
    return Math.pow(Math.sign(x)*(Math.pow(Math.abs(x),1/n)),m);
}
```

There, that's much better. There's probably an even nicer way of expressing this though, and I haven't thought about special cases that much (such as when $$x=0$$ or $$n=0$$) but this does the job very nicely for my application (I'll think about those later).

Tweaking the code slightly to work with this new function instead of `Math.pow`, we can now successfully draw the heart !
